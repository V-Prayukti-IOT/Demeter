the esp8266 connects with dht11 sensor and with the soil moisture sensor to collect its live data. it sends the live data via mqtt protocol to our home made web server which is running in our raspberry pi. the esp8266 also operates two relay switches which is connected to a water pump model(motor with wheel for demo) and with a rodent repellent(led for demo). it can be monitered and operated via our nodered dashboard.
